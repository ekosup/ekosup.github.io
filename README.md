# Eko Supriyono's Blog

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is the code behind my personal blog.
It's built with Astro and uses the AstroPaper theme as a base.
Here, I mostly write about web development, Django, data visualization, devops, and any topics I am interested in.

## Wanna run this locally?

Here's how you can get it running:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies: npm install
3. Start the dev server: npm run dev

## How it gets online

This site lives on GitHub Pages! Any changes pushed to the main branch should automatically trigger a new deployment (assuming the GitHub Actions workflow is set up!).
